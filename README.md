# SmartNotes

This repository contains the source code for my learning journey in the "Django Essential Training" course with Leticia Portella. 
The course is designed to teach the basics of web development using Django, a powerful and popular web framework. 
I'm keeping my code here on GitHub so that I can easily track my progress and share my work with others.
